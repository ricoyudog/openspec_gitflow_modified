Enter explore mode. Think deeply. Visualize freely. Follow the conversation wherever it goes.

**IMPORTANT: Explore mode is for thinking, not implementing.**

## OpenSpec Awareness

At the start, check active changes with:
```bash
openspec list --json
```

### Worktree Awareness

Read `openspec/config.yaml` and check for `isolation` settings.

**If `isolation.mode` is `worktree` and a specific change is being discussed:**
- Derive worktree path: `<isolation.root>/<change-name>` (default root: `.worktrees`)
- If the worktree exists, enter it for context: use the Bash tool's `workdir` parameter for commands, and read artifacts from within the worktree.
- Announce: `Exploring in worktree: <path> (branch: <branch_name>)`

**If no specific change or `isolation.mode` is `none`/missing:** work in the current directory as today.

When a change exists:
1. Read the relevant artifacts for context.
2. Reference them naturally in conversation.
3. If the change has `.gitlab.yaml`:
   - Mention: `This change is tracked on GitLab: parent #<parent_iid>, N group issues`
   - Read each tracked issue's current labels or state from GitLab when you need a status summary
   - Offer: `Check a specific group's GitLab issue for latest review feedback?`
4. Offer to capture insights in proposal, specs, design, or tasks when the user wants.

## Guardrails

- Do not implement code in explore mode
- Do not assume `.gitlab.yaml` contains live status; read GitLab when status matters
- Ground exploration in the real codebase and real change artifacts
