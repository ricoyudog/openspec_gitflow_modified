Archive a completed change in the experimental workflow.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select change and resolve worktree**

   Read `openspec/config.yaml` for `isolation` settings.

   **If `isolation.mode: worktree`**: Changes live inside worktrees, not the main checkout. Read `references/worktree-discovery.md` for the full discovery procedure. Quick summary:
   1. `openspec list --json` — if it returns changes, use them
   2. If empty (new session from main checkout): scan `<isolation.root>/` directories, verify each with `git worktree list` and check `openspec/changes/<name>/` exists inside
   3. Auto-select if one found, prompt if multiple
   4. ALL subsequent work uses the worktree as workdir

   **If no isolation**: `openspec list --json` directly. Auto-select if one, prompt if multiple.

   If name provided by user, use it directly.

   **If `isolation.mode` is `none` or missing:** continue as today.

2. **Check artifact completion status**

   Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` and warn if artifacts are incomplete.

3. **Check task completion status**

   Read `tasks.md` if it exists. Warn if incomplete tasks remain.

4. **Assess delta spec sync state**

   Check for delta specs at `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/` and prompt whether to sync before archive.

4.5 **Update GitLab issues (if tracked)**

   Read `openspec/changes/<name>/.gitlab.yaml` BEFORE archiving moves it.

   If tracking exists:
   - For each child issue, verify its current labels before changing:
     ```bash
     glab issue view <child_iid> --output json | jq -r '.labels[]'
     ```
     If the child already has `workflow::done`, skip the label change for that child.
     If the child has none of `workflow::todo`, `workflow::in-progress`, or `workflow::review`, STOP and report:
     "⚠️ Child issue #\<child_iid\> has unexpected labels: \<actual labels\>. Aborting."
     Otherwise proceed:
      ```bash
      glab issue update <child_iid> --unlabel "workflow::todo,workflow::in-progress,workflow::review" --label "workflow::done"
      ```
      Note: Do NOT close the issue. Closing removes issues from board label columns.
   - Post a final note on the parent issue:
      ```bash
      glab issue note <parent_iid> --message "Change '<name>' archived. All groups done. Specs synced: <yes/no/skipped>."
      ```
   - Verify the parent issue's current labels before changing:
     ```bash
     glab issue view <parent_iid> --output json | jq -r '.labels[]'
     ```
     Confirm `workflow::backlog` is present. If not, STOP and report:
     "⚠️ Expected label `workflow::backlog` on parent issue but found: \<actual labels\>. Aborting label change."
   - Move the parent issue to done (do NOT close):
      ```bash
      glab issue update <parent_iid> --unlabel "workflow::backlog" --label "workflow::done"
      ```

   If glab is unavailable or `.gitlab.yaml` is missing, skip silently.

4.7 **Extract long-term memory (if memory structure exists)**

   If `memory/` and `wiki/` directories exist in the project root:
   - Invoke the **corgispec-memory-extract** skill against the current change
   - This extracts reusable patterns to `wiki/patterns/`, creates a session summary at `wiki/sessions/<name>.md`, updates `wiki/hot.md` lifecycle, resets `memory/session-bridge.md`, and updates `wiki/index.md`
   - If memory-extract reports issues (e.g., session summary already exists), note them in the archive summary but do not block
   - If `memory/` or `wiki/` do not exist, skip this step silently (project may not use memory layer)

5. **Perform the archive**

   Create `openspec/changes/archive/` if it does not exist and move the change to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>`.

5.5 **Clean up worktree (if isolation active)**

   If worktree isolation is active (from step 1.3) and the worktree exists:
   - Remove the worktree:
     ```bash
     git worktree remove <worktree-path> --force
     ```
   - **Do NOT delete the branch.** The branch `<branch_name>` remains for the user to merge via MR.
   - Announce: `Worktree removed. Branch <branch_name> preserved — create an MR to merge it, or run \`git branch -d <branch_name>\` to discard.`

6. **Display summary**

   Show:
   - Change name
   - Schema
   - Archive location
   - Spec sync status
   - GitLab status if tracked
   - Any warnings acknowledged during archive

**Output On Success**

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** synced / skipped / no delta specs
**GitLab:** parent and child issues moved to done (open, not closed)
**Worktree:** removed (branch `<branch-name>` preserved) / not applicable
```

**Guardrails**
- Always prompt for change selection if not provided
- Use `openspec status --json` for completion checking
- Don't block archive on warnings; inform and confirm
- Preserve `.openspec.yaml` and `.gitlab.yaml` by moving the full directory
- If delta specs exist, always assess sync before archive
