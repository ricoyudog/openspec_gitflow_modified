# Hot — OpenSpec GitFlow Latest

> ~500 words | Hard cap 600 words | Updated every session | First entry point for humans and AI

## Active Changes
- `bootstrap-install` branch/worktree contains an uncommitted implementation of the single-entry bootstrap installer flow.

## Recent Decisions
- Initialized memory structure
- Installation onboarding is being collapsed onto `corgispec bootstrap` plus a fetchable `.opencode/INSTALL.md`, with README quick starts reduced to the bootstrap-first path.
- Bundle-asset tests must use isolated output paths instead of rebuilding the shared `packages/corgispec/assets` directory during the Vitest suite.

## Architecture Pulse
- **Stable**: OpenSpec schema/workflow toolkit, skill metadata model, three-directory skill mirroring, OpenCode and Claude command support
- **Evolving**: `corgispec` as the unified CLI replacing legacy tooling, GitHub/GitLab tracked workflow assets, cross-session memory workflows
- **Legacy**: `tools/ds-skills/` and `install-skills.sh`

## Recent Pitfalls
- (none yet — see [[memory/pitfalls]])

## Recently Shipped
- `bootstrap-install` worktree: `corgispec bootstrap`, bundled command/memory assets, reusable install/memory helpers, bootstrap reports, and bootstrap-focused docs/tests. Verified with `npm test` in `packages/corgispec` (114 passing tests).
